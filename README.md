# DGGAL, the Discrete Global Grid Abstraction Library

DGGAL provides a common interface to perform various operations on Discrete Global Grid Reference Systems (DGGRS), facilitating the implementation of Discrete Global Grid Systems (DGGS),
including implementing Web APIs based on the [OGC API - DGGS Standard](https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/21-038.html).
